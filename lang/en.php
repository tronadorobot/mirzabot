 💡 Frequently asked questions ⁉️

1️⃣ Does your VPN have a static IP? Can I use it for cryptocurrency exchanges?

✅ Due to the internet situation and the country\'s restrictions, our service is not suitable for trading and only has a static location.

2️⃣ If I renew my account before it expires, do the remaining days burn?

✅ No, the remaining days of the account are counted at renewal, and if, for example, you renew your 1-month account 5 days before it expires, you get 5 remaining days + 30 renewed days.

3️⃣ What happens if we connect to one account more than the allowed limit?

✅ In that case, your service volume will run out quickly.

4️⃣ What type is your VPN?

✅ Our VPNs are v2ray and we support various protocols so that even during times when the internet is disrupted, you can use your service without problems or speed drops.

5️⃣ Which country is the VPN from?

✅ Our VPN server is from Germany

6️⃣ How should I use this VPN?

✅ For a tutorial on using the app, press the «📚 Tutorial» button.

7️⃣ The VPN doesn\'t connect, what should I do?

✅ Contact support along with an image of the error message you receive.

8️⃣ Is your VPN guaranteed to always connect?

✅ Due to the unpredictable internet situation in the country, giving a guarantee is not possible; we can only guarantee that we will do our best to provide the best possible service.

9️⃣ Do you offer refunds?

✅ A refund is possible if the problem is not resolved on our end.
